# ARMS program Europe
*A Joint Research Activity in [AssemblePLUS](http://assembleplus.eu)*
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

This project is setting up a network of [Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures](http://arms.biocodellc.com/) (ARMS) in the vicinity of marine stations and Long term Ecological Research sites (LTER) in order to assess status and changes in hard bottom communities of near coast environments. One of the initial scientific goals of the project is to identify newly arrived Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) and track the migration of already known NIS in European continental waters. In addition we deploy ARMS for longer periods to obtain monitor hard-bottom communities with genetic methods. 

ARMS are three-dimensional units attached to the sea floor and consisting of a stack of settlement plates. These monitoring systems were originally developed during the Census of Marine Life project and are today frequently used for passive collection of marine fauna. Because of their three-dimensional structure, mimicking the complexity of hard bottom marine substrates, ARMS attract both encrusting species and motile organisms. 

The European ARMS program will consist of three annual cycles (2018, 2019, and 2020), with each cycle having a design, deployment, and analysis phase. The project is primarily funded through the Joint Research Activity JRA1 of the [ASSEMBLE+](http://assembleplus.eu) program, but has relations to European infrastructure and monitoring programs, such as e.g. [European Marine Biological Resource Center](http://www.embrc.eu/), and is supported by the [Genomic observatories network](http://genomicobservatories.org/) as well as the Interreg project [GEANS](https://northsearegion.eu/geans/). 

This handbook in this repository gives an overview over the state of the activity, the network of sites and scientists, as well as the necessary protocols for ARMS deployment, retrieval and processing. 

This repository contains the laters version of the handbook as appended documents, incl
1.	Project registration sheet (only relevant for new partners)
2.	Metadata sheet (template) 
3.	Metadata sheet (example)
