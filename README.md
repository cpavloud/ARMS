# ARMS
This project is setting up a network of Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) in the vicinity of marine stations and Long term Ecological Research sites (LTER) in order to assess status and changes in hard bottom communities of near coast environments. The initial scientific purpose of the project is to identify newly arrived Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) and track the migration of already known NIS in European continental waters. The project will consist in three annual cycles, with each cycle consisting of a design, deployment, and analysis phase (Fig 1). The project is primarily funded through the Joint Research Activity JRA1 of the ASSEMBLE+ program (http://assembleplus.eu), but has relations to European infrastructure and monitoring programs, such as e.g. European Marine Biological Resource Center (www.embrc.eu), the Genomic observatories network (http://genomicobservatories.org/), and the Interreg project GEANS (https://northsearegion.eu/geans/). This handbook gives an overview over the state of the activity, the network of sites and scientists, as well as the necessary protocols for ARMS deployment, retrieval and processing.
